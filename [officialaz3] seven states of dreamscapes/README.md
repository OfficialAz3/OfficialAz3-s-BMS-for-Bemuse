Hello! Az3 here.

This track is considered as a sequel to five states of weirdness back from BOF:NT.
The fact that it ended up nicely on the ranking and the fearful response from the charters who attempt on charting purely quintuplets,
I decided to make a sequel that is mainly septuplets, but with a twist.

I made some instruments purely microtonal with different tuning systems.
The bass plays in standard 12-edo.
The pluck and the rhode synths however plays in 7-edo.
But the best of all, the square lead synth plays in 49-edo!

I also tried incorporating tempo modulation and the standard 15:16 polyrhythm at one part, but I'm not really sure if it sounds good for other people.

The theme for this work is requested from the team leader Alex Turell, "dreamcore"
It's a shame I didn't use it as a genre.
