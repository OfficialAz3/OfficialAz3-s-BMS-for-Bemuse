In her life-changing event being so sudden, her grieving stages has begun.

Hello! Az3 here.

I want to give a special shoutout to Echa who took part contributing the production of the music as the rapper!
Not only he did his best to rap each words, but he pronounced each syllables and accents of Filipino language so accurately. ^^
Even though the tone of his voice might sound goofy in certain parts, he still really tried his best.

This is also my first time using voice synthesizer for a song and showcasing it into public.

Anyways, as you can see from the title, this work is meant to be themed during the 1st stage of grief.
The 1st stage of grief is Denial.

The lyrics are in 1st-person perspective, which details the main character's feelings after being told the news that could change her.
In addition, the second verse is spoken from """her""" perspective, which in this case is sung by Hodong (vocal synthesizer).

I really tried my best to do some proper songwriting and storytelling so that I could develop this type of skill in the future.
And in addition, the entire song is written 50 cents below to make the listeners feel something unsettling whilst there is nothing happening.
You can prove this by listening this song and other song at the same time.

------------------- Lore (Georgia) -------------------

If you really analyzed some of my past songs, you may have noticed this """her""" refers to one of the character in my story.
"Georgia"

I've been making a story about her journey of suffering her grief, and finding her ways to cope and accept that grievous feeling.
And this entry in particular served as the final piece of her puzzle.
And thus, her story is complete.

The ending of each song relates to the next entry of the story.

1st Stage : Tears of Denial (BOF21) - "In the end, she cannot accept"
2nd Stage : High Blood (BOF:TT) - "She just couldn't take it anymore"
3rd Stage : Longing 'till Remorse (BOF:NT) - "She coped and coped"
4th Stage : Childhood Dream (BOFXVII) - "Seeing myself in pain"
5th Stage : Without his Presence (BOF:ET) - "Her real farewell"
