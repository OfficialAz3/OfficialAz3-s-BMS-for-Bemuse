As the rocket flew to the colorful horizon,
The planet's birth had set the overseer's eyes upon.
Seeing the destruction caused before,
Observing every detail once more,
Its vibrance strikes their reflective retina as shown.

Hello! Az3 here.

Knowing scarlet's sudden fame and the achievements that have come along with it made me realize that I should continue doing a style like this.
And so, this is now going to be my new music series, "the world of colors".
This is where I try to express an obscurely named colors through music.
I have already done it with scarlet, with it expressed through loss and beauty.
But for the second color periwinkle, I express it with creation and curiosity.

In addition, the work is also sampled through several Cymatics piano samples instead of just 1.
I did some sound design stuff and made this glitchy texture that the original scarlet had.
I also wanted to stray away from pure hyperflip-oriented breakcore and focused more on liquid stuff.
Hence, you can see why this track really sounded liquidy.
It might be a disappointment to some listeners, but I promise it won't be once I expand this "the world of colors" series that I'm planning.

Also, the world of scarlet extended ver. is still on the works and is near completion.
I'll try my best to capture some story-based detail on the extended work whilst keeping it as chaotic as the original version for the hype.
Also also, I don't really expect this entry to bomb up in ranking compared to scarlet, but my goal is to keep this within Top 100 range.
Wish me luck! ^^

Lastly, the theme of this entry is about "the creation and your curiosity about it".
This also follows scarlet's ending. "The death of the past comes a creation of the new one."
